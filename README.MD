# Welcome to JSmooCh

JSMooCh started as C ports of my emulators from JSMoo. It has since then expanded into more emulators.

There is a fairly heavy emphasis on debugging, with cores offering different features as they make sense for a platform.

jsmooch-gui is the front-end GUI app.
jsmooch-lib is the C11 library of emulators, agnostic to front-end.
jsmooch-tests are some tests for jsmooch-lib

Current progress, alphabetical order:

* Atari 2600 - needs a lot of work, can't really play games. Mostly needs work on graphics
* Apple IIe - emulator roughed out but not really tested
* Dreamcast - emulator loads homebrew, boots BIOS to the point of 3d commands. Work paused there
* GameBoy - GameBoy and Color support, with sound, pretty well. A few glitches here and there still
* GameBoy Advance - Early WIP
* Genesis/MegaDrive - Currently has pretty decent compatability, but I'm working on icnreasing it.
* Mac Classic - Boots to sad Mac. Needs work on floppies.
* NES - Pretty good compatability, with sound. Needs a little more work on sound
* Master System/Game Gear - Pretty good compatability, with sound.
* PlayStation - not ported from JSMoo yet
* Super NES - not ported from JSMoo yet

More detailed info on each to come!
